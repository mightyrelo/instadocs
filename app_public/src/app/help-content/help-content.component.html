  here I'm seeing a simple table with three columns.
  Column1 names a task, column2 names the steps and the third column is a short clip on how to do the task.
  This leads to me create a model of a task. Its attributes will be name, a list of steps and a video or a link
  to a video.
  The user manual will basically be the first two columns of the table
